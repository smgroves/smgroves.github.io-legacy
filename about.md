Welcome to my site! I am currently a grad student in a cancer systems biology lab studying phenotypic transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer. I love that the problems I get to solve allow me to apply physics and math, which I have a B.S. in from the College of William and Mary, to biological problems.
