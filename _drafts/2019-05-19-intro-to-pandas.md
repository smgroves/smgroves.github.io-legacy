  title: "Introduction to Pandas and Sci-Kit Learn"
---

Each spring semester for the past two years, I've been a TA for the graduate-level Cancer Systems Biology course at Vanderbilt. We are still refining the course each year, but one difficulty that comes up every year in teaching this class is that the students have very diverse computational backgrounds. Usually some will have a solid handle on a few programming languages (probably Python and R), and others will have never coded before. One of the sections of the course is meant to develop the students' skills with working with big data from a machine learning perspective, which culminates into a competition of who can make the best classifier for a biomedical dataset. This resource is meant for those students, but will hopefully be valuable to anyone who is somewhat new to python and needs help with Pandas dataframes, or is interested in a Python framework for unsupervised and supervised learning.
