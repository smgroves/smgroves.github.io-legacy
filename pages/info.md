Welcome to my site! I am currently a grad student in a cancer systems biology lab and Vanderbilt University. I study phenotypic transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer. After receiving a B.S. in physics and math from The College of William and Mary, I entered Vanderbilt as a student in their quantitative and chemical biology program. I currently am a PhD candidate in the Quaranta Lab. I love that my project requires me to apply physics and math to biological problems.
