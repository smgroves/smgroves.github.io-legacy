## Research Experience

#### Predicting Drivers of Plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer using Sequencing Data Analysis
2022-Current | Postdoctoral Researcher in the Quaranta and Hiebert Labs at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN \
Analyzing chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics datasets (scATAC-seq & scRNA-seq) to understand epigenetic regulation of lung cancer phenotypes. Facilitating collaboration between two labs at Vanderbilt to plan experimental design and coordinate omics data collection. The goal of this project is to combine computational modeling and bioinformatics tools to predict lineage drivers for variant SCLC models. 


#### Network Control of Cell Identity and Plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer
2017-2022 | Graduate Researcher in the Quaranta Lab at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN \
*Graduate Thesis Laboratory* 
Developed and applied a network inference algorithm to determine the epigenetic regulation and stability of phenotypic subtypes of SCLC. Developed a bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing changes in cell identity (scRNA-seq) in classic and variant models of SCLC. Overall, this project led to insights into how intratumoral heterogeneity and plasticity may allow SCLC tumors to overcome therapy and gain resistance.

#### Graduate Program Laboratory Rotations
2016-2017 | Graduate Researcher at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN\
Completed four 8-week rotations in labs that were interested in myosin tracking to tips of microvilli, effect of ECM stiffness on cancer cell growth, modeling of drug-induced dynamics in melanoma, and fetal membrane developmental dynamics.

#### Undergraduate Senior Thesis: Apnea Analysis in Preterm Infants
2015-2016 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA  \
Programmed a biophysical ‘Query User Data Interface’ in MATLAB for the Apnea of Prematurity group at UVA and William and Mary. The goal of this project was to streamline data acquirement for the neonatal intensive care unit at UVA.

#### Design of Experiments for the 2015 CLOUD Run
Summer 2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at University of Michigan, CERN,
Geneva, Switzerland  \
Worked under Hamish Gordon and Jasper Kirkby. Used statistical analysis and coding in R of a Kriging model emulator, based on a 5 dimensional Maximin Latin Hypercube, to determine how cloud formation depends on five atmospheric variables. The goal of this project was to design the experiments for the fall 2015 run of the CERN CLOUD experiment.

#### Properties of Silk Studied by Atomic Force Microscopy
2014-2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA  \
Investigated the structure and physical properties of brown recluse spider silk by learning to useatomic force microscopy in the Nanomaterials and Imaging Laboratory of Applied Science.

#### Analyzing the Viscoelastic Properties of Langmuir Monolayers
Summer 2014 | Undergraduate Researcher at University of Chicago and
Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL  \
Worked at the University of Chicago and at Argonne National Laboratory APS Sector 15 with ChemMatCARS under the MRSEC program (Materials Research Science and Engineering Center). Analyzed the rheology of nanoparticle and phospholipid monolayers under oscillatory compression to quantitatively describe the viscoelastic properties of the films.

#### Global Fits to the Precision Proton Form Factor Data from Mainz
2014-2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA  \
The goal of this project was to statistically analyze data from Mainz, and to seek an empirical model of the electron charge distribution in the proton to determine its RMS radius, which would address a discrepancy in proton size from varying experiments. Work published as paper: “Consistency of electron scattering data with a small proton radius” published in Physics Review C.
