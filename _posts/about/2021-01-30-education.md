## Education

Current | PhD Candidate in Chemical and Physical Biology, **Vanderbilt
University**, Nashville, TN
Advisor: Dr. Vito Quaranta, M.D., Professor of Biochemistry and
Pharmacology


2012-2016 | Bachelors of Science in Physics and Mathematics, **College
of William and Mary**, Williamsburg, VA


## Research Experience


Current | Graduate Researcher at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN \
*Thesis Laboratory* \
*Phenotypic Plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer*\

2016-2017 | Graduate Researcher at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN\
*Laboratory Rotations*\
Completed four 8-week rotations in labs that were interested in myosin tracking to tips of microvilli, effect of ECM stiffness on cancer cell growth, modeling of drug-induced dynamics in melanoma, and fetal membrane developmental dynamics.

2015-2016 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA \
*Senior Thesis: Apnea Analysis in Preterm Infants* \
Programmed a biophysical ‘Query User Data Interface’ in MATLAB for the Apnea of Prematurity group at UVA and William and Mary. The goal of this project was to streamline data acquirement for the neonatal intensive care unit at UVA.

Summer 2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at University of Michigan, CERN,
Geneva, Switzerland \
*Design of Experiments for the 2015 CLOUD Run* \
Worked under Hamish Gordon and Jasper Kirkby. Used statistical analysis and coding in R of a Kriging model emulator, based on a 5 dimensional Maximin Latin Hypercube, to determine how cloud formation depends on five atmospheric variables. The goal of this project was to design the experiments for the fall 2015 run of the CERN CLOUD experiment.


2014-2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA \
*Properties of Silk Studied by Atomic Force Microscopy* \
Investigated the structure and physical properties of brown recluse spider silk by learning to useatomic force microscopy in the Nanomaterials and Imaging Laboratory of Applied Science.


Summer 2014 | Undergraduate Researcher at University of Chicago and
Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL \
*Analyzing the Viscoelastic Properties of Langmuir Monolayers* \
Worked at the University of Chicago and at Argonne National Laboratory APS Sector 15 with ChemMatCARS under the MRSEC program (Materials Research Science and Engineering Center). Analyzed the rheology of nanoparticle and phospholipid monolayers under oscillatory compression to quantitatively describe the viscoelastic properties of the films.


2014-2015 | Undergraduate Researcher at College of William and Mary,
Williamsburg, VA \
*Global Fits to the Precision Proton Form Factor Data from Mainz* \
The goal of this project was to statistically analyze data from Mainz, and to seek an empirical model of the electron charge distribution in the proton to determine its RMS radius, which would address a discrepancy in proton size from varying experiments. Work published as paper: “Consistency of electron scattering data with a small proton radius” published in Physics Review C.
