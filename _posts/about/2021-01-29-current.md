My current research focuses on phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). I am currently in my sixth year as a PhD candidate, and most of my work includes computational modeling and bioinformatic analyses of single cell transcriptomics, such as trajectory inference and subtype identification. I helped to develop a tool called <a href=' https://smgroves.github.io/projects/booleabayes/'>BooleaBayes</a> that using bulk RNA sequencing data to derive gene regulatory network models. A less jargon-y description of this method can be found in my blog post series starting <a href=' https://smgroves.github.io/projects/booleabayes/1'>here.</a> I have applied this tool to other cancer systems and SCLC datasets, which are highlighted in my recent publications. I am working on developing a version of this tool that can be used with pseudo-temporal single cell sequencing data.

My most recent work is focused on quantifying phenotypic plasticity in SCLC. I have placed SCLC cell types within a framework known as archetype analysis, which suggests underlying evolutionary mechanisms that may explain the existence of several stable subtypes. We then define a metric of plasticity to evaluate the ability of cells to transition to other phenotypes relative to archetype space. These methods are detailed in my preprint <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.427865v1'>here</a> and the blog post series <a href=' https://smgroves.github.io/projects/mazebox/'>here.</a>
