Have you ever thought about how different cells in your body came to be? You may have heard that you have a particular *genome* that is shared by virtually all of your cells. So why does, for example, a heart cell act so differently from a lung cell? How does a cell located in your heart learn to "turn on" heart cell functions, and "turn off" lung cell functions? And if you took that heart cell and moved it to the lung, would it be able to change its function and start acting like a lung cell?

These are all questions of cell identity. Cell identity can be defined in many different ways, but generally we think of a cell’s identity as the array of functioning proteins that cause a cell to have specific behaviors, whether that is in terms of interaction with other cells, functions in the body, or in response to external signals and perturbations. For example, the figure below shows a variety of cell types that exist within the lung, all of which have distinct functions, such as moving air and particles through the trachea (ciliated cells), cells that produce surfactant to protect the lung epithelium (club cells), or cells that assist in lung development and recovery after injury (Pulmonary Neurendocrine Cells, or PNECs).

Al of these cells likely have the same genome, or specific patterns of DNA, if they come from the same (healthy) person. But they have different *phenotypes* and *proteomes* (amounts of an array of proteins in each cell), which can be driven by non-genetic processes at the *transcriptomic*, or RNA expression, level. So a cell’s identity– distinguished by its behaviors– is governed by the expression of genes required for certain functions. 

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}dogma.jpg" alt="Like an old-school printing press, DNA is a template that can be used to make many copies of messenger RNA, or mRNA. These RNA copies then get translated into proteins, which are the cellular machines that allow cells to function in different ways. The number of copies of RNA made from the DNA depends on many things, one of which is other proteins whose function is to decide how much DNA is transcribed. These proteins are called transcription factors.">

Often the control of gene expression, or transcriptional regulation, is ascribed to networks of transcription factors that affect the level of expression, or amount of RNA, in each cell. 

For example, this image is showing three different TFs (two activators and one repressor), and when they TFs bind to their targeted regions of DNA, they affect how much of the target gene is transcribed and therefore how much of that protein is made.
