title:  "BooleaBayes Part 2: Network Structure and Dynamics"
teaser: "This analysis was written to analyze transcription factor networks for Small Cell Lung Cancer phenotypes. I've written a primer on gene regulatory network dynamics and how our computational tool is able to define them and make predictions about the future using gene expression data-- RNA sequencing data that tells you the identity of a population of cells."
